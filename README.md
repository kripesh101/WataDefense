# WataDefense
A Spigot (Minecraft) Plugin 

Plugin currently in **Beta**

Latest version: `0.3 Beta`

_Don't expect this plugin to be stable. It's beta for a reason._
_And don't really expect to have much fun either. A majority of features are missing_

```The plugin is for a "Block" defense "mini-game". It involves two teams preparing for a set time (they are isolated at this state), then fighting to reach each-other's bases until one guy takes other team's "Block", and returns to their base with the block and wins the game for their team.```
