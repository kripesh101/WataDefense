# WataDefense
A Spigot (Minecraft) Plugin 

Plugin currently in **Beta**

Latest version: `0.4-Beta`

_Don't expect this plugin to be stable. It's beta for a reason._
_It's not feature complete yet._

**Version 0.4-Beta hasn't been tested yet. I'll remove this warning after I do some testing.**

```The plugin is for a "Block" defense "mini-game". It involves two teams preparing for a set time (they are isolated at this state), then fighting to reach each-other's bases until one guy takes other team's "Block", and returns to their base with the block and wins the game for their team.```

Credits to **Watashi** for the idea of this plugin. Find him on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/mack.pandey) and [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198378308596).

Plans for future versions:

* Chest (configurable) at team-spawn with items to speed up preparation.
* PEX integration so that the permission groups needed for the `/ll` command work without prior configuration.
* Clean-up the code.
